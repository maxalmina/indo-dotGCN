however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my $T$ before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .

my main concern was the sanity of the $T$ that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .

my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten $T$ , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
