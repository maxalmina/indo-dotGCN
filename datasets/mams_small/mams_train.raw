I noticed many of the other comments had negative things to say about the service and $T$ - my thoughts and suggestions are : eat at the bar to avoid a rude waiter or bad service here and Artisanal 's reputation is based on the cheese , get the CHEESE and not the steak or whatever .

They 've got some of the best french toast you 'll ever eat for Sunday $T$ , and while their dinner menu has n't changed much in the past few years , their food is reliable and they I always find something new in their chicken or fish specials , which are usually prepared with a red or white wine - based sauce .
