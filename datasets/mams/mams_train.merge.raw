Since the $T$ is not organized in the way to describe the size of each dish , and there is no omakase nor a course , waiter 's recommendation may be crucial to decide what to order , but he just recommended what he likes without considering appropriate amount for one person , and even served shellfish to whom who had mentioned she is allergic to shellfish !

The $T$ sounded good but the grilled eggplant roll was oversauced with a pile of mint , pork chop was leathery , and everything just tasted wrong .
