Since the $T$ is not organized in the way to describe the size of each dish , and there is no omakase nor a course , waiter 's recommendation may be crucial to decide what to order , but he just recommended what he likes without considering appropriate amount for one person , and even served shellfish to whom who had mentioned she is allergic to shellfish !

The line gets a bit claustrophobic , since you 're jammed against the counter , but the enormous Greek salad ( replete with herbed feta , slightly sweet dolmades and a $T$ ) , the baba ghanouj and the eponymous falafel are great , as are the spanokopita and other spur - of - the - moment pastries they always seem to be featuring .
