i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this $T$ does n't have an upscale feel .

also , $T$ try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .

however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my $T$ before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .

my main concern was the sanity of the $T$ that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .

my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten $T$ , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .

the $T$ itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .

the presentation of $T$ is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu .

to start off , approximately 8 - 10 oz of $T$ will cost you $ 3 .
orange juice

they serve it in a tall , skinny hour - glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small $T$ at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .

i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their $T$ was so unique that i continued .
menu

the $T$ were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 " $ t$ ( one of them was more like 5 " ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different $ t$ ) is well over - priced .
pancakes
1
the $T$ should be larger ( at least 8 " ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .
pancakes

on my meal i had to send back my $T$ for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n't rejected the meal all together .

meal

i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the $T$ and i was too frustrated to continue .
dish

to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no $T$ stopped by to ask what the problem was .

ray 's is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous $T$ , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .

my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous $T$ , smoked albacore tuna , ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .
